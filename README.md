# Efficient-Data-Structures-in-Action-Group-
This project implements advanced data structures including a d-dimensional point quadtree for efficient spatial queries, a lazy binomial heap for optimized priority queue operations, and demonstrates the equivalence between 2-3-4 trees and red-black trees. It emphasizes performance, testing, and documentation to ensure robust functionality in C#.
